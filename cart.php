  <h2>Artist's Perspective</h2>
  
  <p>People appreciate art in different ways, whether it’s music, dance, poetry, drawings, paintings, or even graffiti. Some like to be directly involved in the creation of the art (artists) while others like to experience and appreciate it. Whatever the case, the arts play a big role in how humans see and interact with others and the world in general. Art helps us emotionally, financially, psychologically, and even helps to shape individual and collective personality.</p>
  <p>Humans have had a relationship with art, in one form or another, since time immemorial. From prehistoric cave drawings to ancient instruments, it is obvious that art has always been and will continue to be an interwoven part of our existence, regardless of race, political leanings, or cultural background.</p>
   <h2>Art crosses all divides</h2>
<p>Works of art, whether in physical or intangible form, can often easily be understood by people from different social, cultural, and political backgrounds. It’s one of the reasons why music is referred to as a musical language. Also, through observation of artifacts and artworks, as well as the messages encoded in literature, music, and poetry, it is possible to gain insight and understanding of other people’s history and present-day realities.</p>
  <h2>Art is good for you</h2>
  <p>From beautifying the surroundings to helping to alleviate stress and discomforts, art is essential for physical, emotional, and mental wellbeing. Music, for example, is increasingly used by people to battle depression and other mental illnesses. For art creators, including musicians, dancers, painters, and writers, creating or performing a piece of art is a cathartic experience that also provides a sense of achievement. There are numerous studies showing how people feel better whether by creating art or by consuming it or by simply being in the presence of something art-related.</p>

<p>Likewise, the different types of art in play in today’s society will help future generations understand what the world was like before they came along. In addition, through the messages embedded in art, people can see and understand mistakes from the past, which will inform decisions as to how to avoid them.
Whether you consider yourself an artist or just someone who loves art in one or all of its many forms, it’s easy to see why art is important to the world and its people. Take some time to appreciate some art today.</p>
